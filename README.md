#K_means-on-iris-dataset

Applying K-means on miris dataset with 4 features:
sepal length in cm
sepal width in cm
petal length in cm
petal width in cm
and 150 instances.

All 150 instances in the test file have been assigned to 3 cluster ids given by 1, 2 or 3 and then evaluating the model based on V-measure. 
The trained model can be used for second part of the project. 

Input Data (provided as new_test.txt) consists of 10,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). 
The images were scanned and scaled into 28x28 pixels. For every digit, each pixel can be represented as an integer in the range [0, 255] where 0 corresponds to the pixel being completely white, and 255 corresponds to the pixel being completely black. 
This gives us a 28x28 matrix of integers for each digit. We can then flatten each matrix into a 1x784 vector. No labels are provided.
